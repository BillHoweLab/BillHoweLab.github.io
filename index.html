      Generative AI is enabling automation experiments in every sector of research, government, and industry: 
      answering questions, summarizing text, desrcibing images, generating code, manipulating data.
      But these experiments represent poor science: For the largest and most commonly used models, 
      the data used for training are unreleased and undescribed, as is the training process. Biases are masked through 
      aggressive use of human labor, with unknown effects.  Quantitative results rely on benchmark tasks designed to be general rather than specific. 
      Ablation studies varying the training data, training process, task details are rare and often impossible due to the scale of the models.  
      Research consists of reporting on dramatic changes in performance resulting from subtle changes to the prompts, results that may change 
      day to day due to the opaque deployment of for-profit models. The risks and limitations of these models are widely reported, but similarly good experiments are difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore rare.
     <p></p>
      Our lab aims to conduct <i>rigorous</i> AI experiments to inform <i>practical</i> AI solutions, on <i>important</i> societal questions.  
      We study foundational questions 
<p></p>
      We draw partnerships and projects primarily from the research community and the public sector, areas typically unsupported by market forces 
      and areas subject to a higher burden of evidence than most companies.
      <p></p>

      Our methods rely on emerging techniques to develop smaller, open source models that can be trained and/or domain-adapted using affordable resources, 
      such that controlled studies are not prohbibtively expensive, and allowing partners to deploy solutions themselves.  We do not subscribe to the idea 
      that using one of a few, large, opaque, private models is required to achieve state of the art performance on most tasks.
